#Instructions


#**Introduction**
Three new preventative aides drugs were tested in clinical trials in 2015. The trial designs were modeled after the famous RV_144 Aides Trials in Thailand in 2009. The three aides drugs were distributed in three different geographical locations, South Carolina, Central Africa, and Korea. 

Our research question is:

Is the drug effective in each region? Is the drug sex specific?


# South Carolina

We will subset the data by sex to see if the drug is sex specific.





# Central Africa

We will subset the data by sex to see if the drug is sex specific.



# Korea

We will subset the data by sex to see if the drug is sex specific.
