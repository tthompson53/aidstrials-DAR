#Instructions


#**Introduction**
Three new preventative aides drugs were tested in clinical trials in 2015. The trial designs were modeled after the famous RV_144 Aides Trials in Thailand in 2009.  Analyze and report on the apparent effectiveness of the three different drugs.

Our research question is:

Does sex of the participant seem to be a factor for any of the drugs?


# South Carolina

We will subset the data by sex to see if the drug is sex specific.

The amount of females infected is lower when receiving the drug, However, the amount of males affected is higher when receiving the drug.



# Central Africa

We will subset the data by sex to see if the drug is sex specific.



# Korea

We will subset the data by sex to see if the drug is sex specific.
